<h3>Advisor Style</h3> 
  
  <ul>
<li><p><b>How would you describe your advising style? Does your approach vary over the course of a student's progress within their degree?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>I try to be “hands on” in advising style, especially early in a student’s career. I expect to be very involved in all aspects of the project lifecycle: project selection, implementation, experiment design, paper writing, presentations, etc. I don’t typically write code for projects, but I am always happy to discuss or give advice on implementation details. As students progress further toward their degree, I expect them to become more independent and thus to become more “hands-off”. I expect more senior students to become more proactive in problem selection, and to need less help with implementation and experimental details. For junior students (especially their first paper) I will sometimes directly edit sections of papers; for more senior students I instead prefer to provide feedback on paper drafts rather than directly edit myself.</p>
