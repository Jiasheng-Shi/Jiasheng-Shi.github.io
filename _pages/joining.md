### Joining the Group
- - -

I'll be starting at University of Toronto just prior to the 2022-23 academic year and will be looking for graduate students with interests related to imaging, optics, signal processing, and machine learning to join my group. I'm also open to postdoc positions, especially if there's a good fit. 

**Graduate Students**<br>If you would like to join the group as a Master's or PhD student, you can apply directly to the [CS department](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/graduate/prospective). The site will open for applications in early October 2021 and the deadline is usually in December. You should list me by name in your application and explain how our research interests are well-aligned. 

If you'd like more information about doing a PhD in Canada, here is a [nice article](https://yongyuanxi.medium.com/myths-about-graduate-school-in-computer-science-in-canada-eca365370415) written by a current student in the department. 

**Postdoc Positions**<br>I will have very limited spots for postdocs in the group, but I am open to hiring postdocs if there's an especially good fit. It's helpful if I'm already aware of your work or you have a good track record of publishing in and around computational imaging, vision, or graphics. If you do reach out, please have a 1-2 year research agenda prepared. You should also be willing to apply for (or have obtained) a postdoc fellowship. Since I won't start my position until July 2022, the earliest possible start date would be Fall 2022, and likely later.

If you think we are a good fit based on this description, send me an email listing your top publications and research agenda. Please keep in mind that I likely won't be able to commit to any hiring decision until much closer to when I start my position.

*I look at all my emails, but due to the volume of emails I receive, I may not be able to reply to each one. If you need to reach out you can contact me at the email listed in my CV.*
