I'm a fifth-year Ph.D. student at Stanford University in the [Computational Imaging Lab](http://www.computationalimaging.org/){:target="_blank"} advised by [Gordon Wetzstein](https://stanford.edu/~gordonwz/). My work is at the intersection of machine learning, computational imaging, and computer vision. Along these lines I've worked on next-generation computational imaging systems for [imaging around corners](http://go.ted.com/davidlindell/){:target="_blank"} and through scattering media, and new machine learning algorithms for representing and processing signals. My work is relevant to a broad range of applications in computer graphics, biomedical imaging, remote sensing, and robotic vision.
