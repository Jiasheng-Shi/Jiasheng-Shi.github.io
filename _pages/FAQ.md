<h3>Advisor Style</h3> 
  
  <ul>
<li><p><b>How would you describe your advising style? Does your approach vary over the course of a student's progress within their degree?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>I try to be “hands on” in advising style, especially early in a student’s career. I expect to be very involved in all aspects of the project lifecycle: project selection, implementation, experiment design, paper writing, presentations, etc. I don’t typically write code for projects, but I am always happy to discuss or give advice on implementation details. As students progress further toward their degree, I expect them to become more independent and thus to become more “hands-off”. I expect more senior students to become more proactive in problem selection, and to need less help with implementation and experimental details. For junior students (especially their first paper) I will sometimes directly edit sections of papers; for more senior students I instead prefer to provide feedback on paper drafts rather than directly edit myself.</p>

</ul>
  
   <ul>
<li><p><b>What is the best way/technology for students to contact you? Are there time frames in which students should expect to hear from you?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>I use a Slack workspace as the main form of communication with students in my research group. We typically create a Slack channel per project, and all students are welcome to join any project channel. Most general project updates should go in project channels. Students can also send me direct messages on Slack if they want to discuss anything more private or personal. Students should generally expect a quick response from me between 10am and 5pm on weekdays. I often check and respond to messages outside that window as well, but I don’t expect students to respond to me outside of those times unless there is something urgent or time-sensitive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
  
    
   <ul>
<li><p><b>How often do you plan to meet with students one-on-one (be as specific as possible, it's okay to describe multiple styles that may vary with student needs)? Is an agenda required? How long are meetings?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>I have a regular weekly meeting with each PhD student. If others are involved in their current project then they typically join this weekly meeting as well. For MS or BS students I schedule regular meetings either every week or every other week depending on the needs of the student and project. Regular student meetings are typically 45 minutes, but can be shrunk to 30 minutes or expanded to an hour depending on the needs of the project. I expect students to send a rough agenda via Slack at least 15 minutes before each meeting, either in the form of a bulleted list or a short slide deck that they plan to present. I know that sometimes depending on the state of the project or when students have other commitments that a meeting might not be required every week; if a student feels that a regularly scheduled meeting would not be helpful for them given the state of the project then they should feel free to cancel it, giving me at least a day’s notice if possible.</p>
