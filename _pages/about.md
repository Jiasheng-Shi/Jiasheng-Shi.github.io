I received Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Chaoli Wang](http://sites.nd.edu/chaoli-wang/). Before that, I obtained my BS in Software Engineering and MS in Computer Software and Theory. Both are from [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/). My research interests lie in the general area of human-computer interaction, scientific visualization and machine learning.

**I'll be joining the Schoole of Data Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen in June 2022!**
