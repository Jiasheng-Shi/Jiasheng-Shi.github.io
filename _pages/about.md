I received Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Chaoli Wang](http://sites.nd.edu/chaoli-wang/). Before that, I obtained my BS in Software Engineering and MS in Computer Software and Theory. Both are from [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/). My research interests lie in the general area of human-computer interaction, scientific visualization, and machine learning.
  
<b>PhD applicants:</b> I will be looking to hire one or two graduate students this year. So please apply directly through the <a href="https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/phd-programmes-CSE">School of Data Science.
  
<br/>
  
<b>Graduate or undergraduate students at CUHK-SZ:</b> Please send me an email with your interests, resume, and transcripts. For undergraduates, the requirement is solid engineering and math skills. I prefer students who've taken some of these classes: DDA2003, CSC4130, CSC4140, and DDA3020.
  
<br/>
<b>Interns:</b> I am also taking visitors. Please send me an email for the details.
