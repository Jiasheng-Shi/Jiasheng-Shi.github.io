I'm a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University in the [Computational Imaging Lab](http://www.computationalimaging.org/){:target="_blank"} advised by [Gordon Wetzstein](https://stanford.edu/~gordonwz/). My work is at the intersection of machine learning, computational imaging, and computer vision. Along these lines I've worked on next-generation computational imaging systems for [imaging around corners](http://go.ted.com/davidlindell/){:target="_blank"} and through scattering media, and new machine learning algorithms for representing and processing signals. My work is relevant to a broad range of applications in computer graphics, biomedical imaging, remote sensing, and robotic vision. 

**I'll be joining the CS department at the University of Toronto in July 2022!**

Students interested in joining my group starting in Fall 2022 should apply to the [Department of Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/graduate/prospective). More on [this page](/joining).
