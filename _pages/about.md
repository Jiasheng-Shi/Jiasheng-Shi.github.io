I received Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Chaoli Wang](http://sites.nd.edu/chaoli-wang/). Before that, I obtained my BS in Software Engineering and MS in Computer Software and Theory. Both are from [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/). My research interests lie in the general area of human-computer interaction, scientific visualization, and machine learning.


Students interested in joining my lab starting in Spring or Fall 2023 should apply to the [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/phd-programmes-CSE).

We also have several openings for research assistant. If you are self-motivated and interested in visualization and deep learning, feel free to send me your CV and transcript by email.
