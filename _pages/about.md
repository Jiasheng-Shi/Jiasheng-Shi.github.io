Hi, I am an assistant professor in the School of Data Science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. 

Before joining CUHKsz, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, at the University of Pennsylvania, and in the Department of Research, at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, during 2019-2023, supervised by Prof. [Yong Chen](https://penncil.med.upenn.edu/about-pi/) and Prof. [Jing Huang](https://www.cceb.med.upenn.edu/bio/jing-huang-phd). I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Statistics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of Prof. [Qi-Man Shao](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/shaoqiman.html). Prior to CUHK, I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Zhejiang University in 2015.  

<b>Research interests:</b> I am broadly interested in developing theory and methodology for analyzing large-scale and complex-structured data to address scientific problems arising from interdisciplinary studies. My current research interests include, [biostatistics] related: learning methods for infectious disease and pandemic prevention, (Electronic Health Records) EHR-based research, distributed analysis, Meta-analysis; and [probability and statistics] related: high-dimensional statistical inference, self-normalized limit theory, asymptotic theory in probability and statistics.  

# <b>PhD applicants:</b> I will be looking to hire one or two graduate students in Fall 2024. So please apply directly through the <a href="https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/phd-programmes-CSE">School of Data Science</a>.
<br/>
<b>Graduate or undergraduate students at CUHK-SZ:</b> Please send me an email with your interests, resume, and transcripts. For undergraduates, the requirement is solid engineering and math skills. I prefer students who've taken some of these classes: DDA2003, CSC4130, CSC4140, and DDA3020.
<br/>
# <b>Interns:</b> I am also taking visitors. Please send me an email for the details.
